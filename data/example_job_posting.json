We’re starting by radically improving the ninety billion pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers’ doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, delightful and personalized experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer \u0026nbsp; to shepherd this backwards industry into the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo date, The Farmer’s Dog has delivered over 1 billion meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to customers, health to their companions, and much-needed change to the way people feed and care for their pets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e#LongLiveDogs\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We Stand For and Where You'll Come In\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s a day in the life of a Software Engineer like here? You’ll work with a talented engineering “pawd” to expand and improve our subscription-based, direct-to-consumer, e-commerce platform that delivers fresh food to pets across the country. Big fan of short feedback loops? You’ll deliver high quality, well-tested and peer-reviewed code to production in minutes using our automated CI/CD pipeline. Your solutions will leverage industry best practices including A/B experiments, feature toggles and canary rollouts to confidently release high-impact features that dog lovers will love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt The Farmer’s Dog collaboration is an imperative. Our team is full of engineers that love to learn and grow. You’ll regularly white board, pair program and review architecture with top-notch peers with experience working at Amazon, Google, Disney, and Apple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have a great team, but there’s still so much to do and figure out. If you’re interested in scale and want to be in the room when those architecture decisions are made: you’re reading the right job description. We’re in that sweet spot of having clear product-market fit, but still having a small enough team that each engineer makes a big impact. You’ll work closely with the team to restructure our application architecture to handle our rapid growth at scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to have the space and agency to make a big impact both for customers, colleagues and our system: The Farmer’s Dog is for you. If you’re looking for a fully-formed organization with a lot of established processes: a larger company would be a better fit. If you’re looking for rapid iteration to find product-market fit: an earlier stage startup would be a better match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOne Team:\u003c/strong\u003e We don’t think of ourselves as “Acquisition Marketers”, “Engineers”, “Data Analysts”, or “Product Managers”. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we don’t think departments matter. We’d rather align ourselves to the goals we’re working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER – getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp; Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we aren’t tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know there’s a better or more impactful way to solve problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp; We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is.\u0026nbsp; We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention.\u0026nbsp; We answer questions and address problems early and proactively.\u0026nbsp; We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe Execute For Impact:\u003c/strong\u003e We don’t subscribe to “best practices” or “industry KPIs”. We’re uninterested in how we compare to “benchmarks”; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we don’t subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles – i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe Are Focused and Work Without Assumption\u003c/strong\u003e: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, “what’s the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?”. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly.
